# Kilva: Malware Analysis Tool 🛡️

Kilva is a Python-based tool that integrates with VirusTotal's API to scan files, check file hashes, analyze URLs, and assess domains for potential threats. Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, a developer, or just someone curious about malware analysis, this tool is designed to simplify the process of detecting malicious content.

---

### Features 🚀
- **File Scanning**: Upload and scan files to check for malware and potential threats.
- **Hash Search**: Look up a file hash (SHA256, MD5, SHA1) to retrieve detailed analysis from VirusTotal.
- **Domain Reputation Check**: Verify the reputation and categories of a domain to identify suspicious websites.
- **URL Scanning**: Check the safety of a URL by submitting it to VirusTotal for analysis.

### How it Works 🧑‍💻
Kilva utilizes VirusTotal's public API to provide real-time analysis and results for various data types, including:
- **Files**
- **Hashes** (SHA256, MD5, SHA1)
- **Domains**
- **URLs**

### Requirements 🔧
Before you begin, you'll need to install some dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for API communication)
- `hashlib` (for file hash calculation)
- `pyfiglet` (for generating banners)
- `colorama` (for adding colors to terminal outputs)

Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests pyfiglet colorama
```

### Getting Started 💻
To get started, clone the repository and run the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kilva.git
cd kilva
python kilva.py
```

### Example Use Cases 📋
1. Scan a file: Upload a file to VirusTotal for a detailed scan.
2. Search by hash: Input a file hash (e.g., SHA256, MD5, SHA1) and retrieve its scan results from VirusTotal.
3. Check a domain: Check the reputation and analysis stats of a specific domain (e.g., `google.com`).
4. Scan a URL: Analyze a URL to determine whether it is safe or malicious.

### Sample Output 🖥️
Here’s an example of a URL analysis:
```bash
🔍 URL Analysis for: http://malicious.example.com
🌟 Reputation: 20
📌 Categories: Malware, Phishing
🔍 Analysis: {'malicious': 12, 'suspicious': 5, 'harmless': 0, 'undetected': 5}
```
